# Attendance Management Application

I have created a student attendance management system using react.js and firebase.\
It provides following functionalities:
1. Input Student Roll No and Name.
2. Check In and Check Out time.
3. Check how many students are present in the school right now.\
All the inputs are properly validated for multiple scenarios.
